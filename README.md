**About this website**


I built a fun little website to play around with coding, especailly HTML! It's a collection of hilarious technical writer memes I found online. Think of it like a chill zone for information developers like us.

I coded it myself in HTML to practice my skills and keep learning new things. It's hosted on GitHub, which is a popular spot for storing code projects.

So, next time you need a good laugh or a break from wrangling technical details, check out my meme collection___
